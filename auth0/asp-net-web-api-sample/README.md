# Auth0 ASP.NET Web API Samples

This was forked from the fine folks at Auth0. It contains a few sample integrations to Auth0 using ASP.NET Web API / .NET Core 3.1. 

The main areas to focus on would be: 

1. Basic addition of the SDK to a .NET Project
2. Usage of `settings.json` to store and read config values
3. Login/Logout functionality
4. Retrieving user claims
